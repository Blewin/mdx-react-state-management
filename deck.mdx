# React State Management workshop using Redux

Prepared by Bartosz Lewi≈Ñski (based on previous workshop by Grzegorz Rozdzialik)

Workshop repo: https://github.com/Blewin/react-redux-state-management-workshop


---

## What will we learn today?
- Solving problems from previous workshops - THE REDUX WAY
- Redux basic elements (actions, reducers, selectors)
- Redux & React debugging

---

## Problem we are solving - state management

Prop drilling can get out of hand.

Redux is an excellent solution for big projects*

---

## What will we do today

We'll work on previous codebase - with Redux!
We'll implement basic elements, and see how they interact.
If time will allow - we'll go deeper!

---

## Initial setup

1. Pull the workshop repository: (ask for link in rocket chat)

```
git clone git@github.com:Blewin/react-redux-state-management-workshop.git
```

2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
5. Explore the `src` directory

```notes
Show auto-reload by modifying `src/App.js`.
```

## Redux Model

---
## State in Redux
```js
{
  party: {
    isJumping: false,
  },
  accounts: {
    alice: 20,
    bob: -2,
    charlie: 13,
  }
}
```
---
## Actions in Redux

```js
dispatch({
    type: 'JUMP'
})
```

```js
dispatch({
    type: 'JOIN PARTY',
    userId: 'alice'
    payload: {
        partyNr: 3,
    }
})
```
---
## Reducer

```js
function partyReducer(state = INITIAL_STATE, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'JUMP':
      return {
        ...state,
        isJumping: true,
      };

    default:
      return state;
    }
  }

```

---

# Before action was reduced
```js
dispatch({
    type: 'JUMP'
})
```

```js
{
    isJumping: false,
    isWild: true,
}
```
---
# After action was reduced
```js
dispatch({
    type: 'JUMP'
})
```
```js
{
    isJumping: true,
    isWild: true,
}
```
---

## Connect

```js
function mapStateToProps(state, props) {
  return {
    value: state.accounts[props.userId],
  }
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch, props) {
  return {
    onIncrement: () => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT', id: props.userId}),
    onDecrement: () => dispatch({type: 'DECREMENT', id: props.userId}),
  }
}

export const ConnectedCounter = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

## Task 1 - what is happening here!?

Task 1: Figure out what was done to this app and have a feel how it works
 - Tool: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools
 - Task: Dispatch an action through the debugger to create an account

---

## First, let's find:
   - react views and where data is rendered from store
   - where actions are dispatched
   - reducers and where data is entered to store
---

# Now let's look
# at redux dev tools

---

## Workshop guidelines
- Branch `task-X` (e.g. `task-1`) - starting point for a step
- Work on `task-X` branch. Use `npm run test` to verify your solution.
- Clueless? Branch `task-X-solution` (e.g. `task-1-solution`) contains an example solution

---

## Task 2 - Let's act on it.
 Debugging is fun, but let's allow users to create users too.


Branch: task-2


### Task: Modify BankStats to have a button that creates an account


Rules:
   - use classname `new-account-button`
   - connect action to a prop `openNewAccount`
   - export mapDispatchToProps (this is full unit test coverage test)
---

## Let's look at my solution

---
## Task 3 - Who wants to be selected?

Task: Display the number of accounts in Bank Stats - reintroducinng previous feature

Let's do it without tests!

Tools you'll learn to use: React update visualiser.

---

## Let's look at my bad solution
## and see why it's bad

---

If you want to, test in branch `task-3-structured` will guide you to a nicer solution

---

## Let's look at proper solution

---
## Task 4 - There are too many accounts! Let's reduce them.

Branch: task-4

Task: implement reducer to remove an account, and add button to do it

Rules:
  - use a button with text "DELETE" inside `Counter`
  - use action with type "DELETE" and attribute `id`

Advanced: add unit tests for reducer
---
## Let's look at the solution

---
## Stretch goal tasks!
 - Introduce action creators! (Important notion)
 - Display number of accounts with balance > 100 in Bank Stats
 - Click to select an account, then put the balance in Bank Stats
 - Watch for rerenders!

## Homework & future work

 - where to put asynchronous operations ?
 - how to manage selectors ?
