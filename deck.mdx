# React - state management workshop

TODO: complete

Slides: http://bit.ly/react-state-slides

Workshop repo: ...

## Task for today

- Admin panel for a bank
- Customer's account balance - a `Counter` component
- Handle multiple customers
- Display the total number of customers
- All the data stored client-side (no API requests etc.)

TODO: add screenshots

---

## Workshop guidelines

- The task is split into steps
- Branch `task-X` (e.g. `task-1`) - starting point for a step
- Work on `task-X` branch. Use `npm run test` to verify your solution.
- Clueless? Branch `task-X-solution` (e.g. `task-1-solution`) contains an example solution
- Finished early? Take a look at _Advanced topics_ for each task and learn more.

## Bottom-up approach

1. Single `Counter` holding one customer's balance
2. Multiple `Counter` components for different customers
3. Display additional information - the number of customers

## Single `Counter` component

```notes
Each component can have its own state
```

Implement a `Counter`.

Features:

- `+` button increments the value
- `-` button decrements the value

<Timer timeLeft={60} />
